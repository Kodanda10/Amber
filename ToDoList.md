# Amber Development Phased Toâ€‘Do List (Authoritative Roadmap)

This document is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for all engineering tasks. It MUST be:
- Updated with every meaningful code change (add/change status, dates, notes)
- Followed with strict TDD (write failing test first, see TDD Template below)
- Reflected in commits (reference Task IDs in commit messages, e.g. `feat(ingest): add revision hash [ING-004]`)
- Aligned with agent-policy: atomic tasks, observable outcomes, repeatable verification.

Legend: 
Status Codes = TODO | WIP | BLOCKED | DONE | DEFERRED
Priority = P0 (critical), P1 (high), P2 (normal), P3 (nice-to-have)

---
## 0. TDD TEMPLATE (Apply to every task)
1. Define acceptance criteria (clear measurable result)
2. Write failing test(s) (unit/integration/e2e) referencing Task ID
3. Implement minimal code to pass
4. Run full relevant suite (backend: pytest, frontend: tsc + future jest, e2e: future playwright)
5. Refactor (remove duplication, improve clarity) without changing behavior
6. Update docs: this file + README/PRD if scope changed
7. Commit with Task ID; push
8. (If applicable) Add coverage / log instrumentation

## 6. MAINTENANCE RULES
- DO NOT remove a task; mark DEFERRED or DONE (preserve history).
- Every new endpoint or model field MUST map to a task row before merge.
- Every commit touching logic MUST reference >=1 Task ID.
- If scope creeps, add a new row BEFORE implementation completion.
- Keep PRD and this list consistent (sync weekly or when major scope changes).

---
## 7. OPEN QUESTIONS
| Question | Blocked Task | Proposed Resolution Deadline |
|----------|--------------|------------------------------|
| Auth provider (custom JWT vs external IdP) | SEC-001 | Before starting SEC-001 |
| Cache technology (Redis vs in-process) | PERF-002 | Prior to implementation |
| Analytics storage (same DB vs warehouse) | ANA-001 | Before Phase P5 |

---
## 8. BACKLOG (Not Yet Prioritized)
- Webhook ingestion adapter framework
- Multi-tenant org boundary (org_id columns)
- Feature flags system
- Post content embeddings & semantic similarity search
- Real-time updates via WebSocket or SSE

_End of authoritative task file. Update diligently._
