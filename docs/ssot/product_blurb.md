Social Media Extraction App — Chhattisgarh Leadership Intelligence

We’re building a Social Media Extraction App that tracks the digital activity of MLAs, Opposition leaders, Collectors, and District profiles across platforms.

Each social post is treated as an Event. From every post we automatically extract:
- What (topic/message),
- When (time/date),
- Where (location/district),
- Whom (people present/mentioned), and
- Said-What (core statement/quote).

This turns unstructured posts into structured datasets and individual digital profiles (leader, officer, district). The system then generates analysis reports showing activity levels, trending issues, co-appearances, and geography-wise patterns—forming a complete social intelligence map for governance, politics, and public engagement.
